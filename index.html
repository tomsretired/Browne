I         am one of them.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My interest         started a few years ago when I was digging in the bottom of an old piece         of furniture and discovered some amazing family history. There were stacks         of letters all neatly bound together. The first pile I saw were correspondence         (perhaps you could call them &quot;love&quot; letters) between my great-grandfather         Charlie and Ada, the woman who would become his bride in about 1892. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I also found         a photograph of my great-great-grandfather in his Civil War uniform and         several letters he had written his wife from the battlefield in 1862 -         1864.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since then         I have found many other items passed down from the generations before         me. These range from quilts and hand-sewn pants to hand written music         from a Vaudeville act to, of course, photographs and newspaper articles.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After searching         through boxes of old pictures and documents and research on the Internet,         I have been able to put together a snapshot of my family history.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the         next days and months, I will be adding these letters and other items I         have found.
